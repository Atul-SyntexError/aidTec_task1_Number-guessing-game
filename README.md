2) System generate a random number between 1 and 100 using the random module.
3) Then use a loop to allow the user to input their guess within 10 attempts.
4) Compare the user's guess with the random number and provide feedback to the user, letting them know if their guess was too high or too low.
5) If the user guesses the number correctly within the 10 attempts, declare them the winner and ask if the want to play again.
6) If the user doesn't guess the number correctly within the 10 attempts, declare the game over and ask either they want to play again.
